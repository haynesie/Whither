#  Whither the Computer Lab?
### by Keven Haynes

#### Introduction
A quick introduction goes here. 
Of regular concern to all at a University are the related costs and effectiveness of spending and investment in material resources.  Laboratory space is always at a heightened level of scrutiny: it not only consumes materials and personel to maintain the facility, but the real estate it occupies forces the stakeholders to make a long-term commitment on an often scarce resource. 
Current states of funding, pedagogy, technology and people all play a part in the evaluation of a resource. The rapidity of change is felt most significantly in fields such as Computer Science, where not only is the technology on which it is based under continuous revision, the methods and the expectations of professionals in the post-educational sector often out-pace the teaching of new students in the subject.  
As a result, opinions on the use and form of a Computer Lab abound.  What had for a long time been a given, the cost and untenable effort to maintain one's own computer for scientific purposes, is no longer a fact - people not only own their own computers, but often own several (not including "devices" that are themselves computers with more power than those that used to exist in labs).  It is the case today that most undergraduates have or intend to purchase a personal computing device for use during their school careers.  It is this "new" reality that puts into question the need for a Computer Lab at all.  
It is not the purpose of this study to to determine whether Computer Labs should still be maintained on campuses, but rather to look at utilization of a facility through actual data.   What is developed here is a proposal for gathering information that can be used to inform both spending choices and relevant long-term design.  While it may seem easy to assume that a lab is not being used, whether by projecting one's own lack of need for it or by seredipitous visits at off hours, it is important that decisions of great potential impact be based on known facts.

#### Interpretation and Conclusions
We need more data.
